Observations(only the weird ones) Diary
----------------------------------------

1st observation : When the events KeyPress and KeyRelease are selected and gnee run when i am replaying it the last key is not being released(because of which the letter associated with that key is continuously being typed even after replay has finished and other windows are clicked).This happens only if recording stopped in the middle of typing.
Conclusion : Probably gnee tells the comp that a key has been pressed and is not able to say the key has been released.So the comp still thinks that that particular key is being pressed until another key is pressed.

2nd observation : The top thing with name of window and minimize,close button is not being considered as a location on desktop.So either the ointer is below it or above.
Conclusion : I think i haven't included one or more events which might be needed to record pointer over tht region.
